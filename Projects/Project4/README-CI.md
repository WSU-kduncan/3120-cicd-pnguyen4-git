# Part 1 - Dockerize it
- CI Project Overview
    - This project is to use Docker to build a container image that runs a webserver and serves a website. Inside the 'website' folder which website content is located and the container image is built using Dockerfile. The reason of this project is to get used to Docker and apache/nginx to deploy a website.

- Run Project Locally
    - Installed Docker:
        - Download Docker Desktop for Windows
        - Inside of Docker Desktop setting, Select "Use WSL 2 based engine" 
        - And now "Docker" commands work from Windows using WSL2 engine.
    - Build an image from the Dockerfile
        - Create Dockerfile in my Project4 directory
        - Choose Ubuntu as a base image for my container
        - Install apache as a web server
        - Copy my website file into my container
        - Set the webserver as the entrypoint
        - Then run command "docker build -t myimage ."
    - Run the container
        - Using command "docker run -d -p 8080:80 myimage". This will start a container based on my image and map port 80 in the container to port 80 on the host 
        - Then using "docker ps -a" to all list the running containers on the system 
    - View the project running in the container 
        - Open a web browser and navigate to the IP address of my Docker host and specify my port in the URL. 

# Part 2 - GitHub Actions and DockerHub
- Process to create public repo in DockerHub
    - Signing up for DockerHub Account, then log in 
    - Click "Create Repository" 
    - Pick a name for my repo 
    - Select "Public"
    - Click "Create"
- Authenticate with DockerHub via CLI
    - Click on my profile name and icon, choose "Account Settings"
    - Click on "Security"
    - Click "New Access Token"
    - Set a name for the token 
    - Click "Create"
    - On my terminal, run "docker login -u nguyepu"
    - At the password prompt, enter the personal access token, then it will pop up "Login Succeeded"
- Push container image to DockerHub (without GitHub Actions)
    - After successfully login to Dockerhub
    - using "docker push My_DockerHub_repo:Tag"
- Configuring GitHub Secrets 
    - In my GitHub repo, hit "Settings" button
    - On the left side bar, Scroll down and find "Secrets and variables", click on that and choose "Actions"
    - Hit "New repository secret"
    - Pick a name for my secrets
    - enter my DockerHub password for the secret 
    - Click "Add secret"
- Behaviour of GitHub Workflow
    - The Github workflow is responsible for biulding and pushing the Docker image to DockerHub, it triggered when I push changes to my GitHub repo
