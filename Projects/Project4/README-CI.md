# Part 1 - Dockerize it
- CI Project Overview
    - This project is to use Docker to build a container image that runs a webserver and serves a website. Inside the 'website' folder which website content is located and the container image is built using Dockerfile. The reason of this project is to get used to Docker and apache/nginx to deploy a website.

- Run Project Locally
    - Installed Docker:
        - Download Docker Desktop for Windows
        - Inside of Docker Desktop setting, Select "Use WSL 2 based engine" 
        - And now "Docker" commands work from Windows using WSL2 engine.
    - Build an image from the Dockerfile
        - Create Dockerfile in my Project4 directory
        - Choose Ubuntu as a base image for my container
        - Install apache as a web server
        - Copy my website file into my container
        - Set the webserver as the entrypoint
        - Then run command "docker build -t myimage ."
    - Run the container
        - Using command "docker run -d -p 80:80 myimage". This will start a container based on my image and map port 80 in the container to port 80 on the host 
        - Then using "docker ps -a" to all list the running containers on the system 
    - View the project running in the container 
        - Open a web browser and navigate to the IP address of my Docker host and specify my port in the URL.
